As, if when there is a patient getting readmitted within 30 days, the hospital faces incentive issues and also Increases the financial expenses of the patient. Taking this into consideration, the aim is to correctly predict the readmission of a diabetic patient so that hospital administration can take prescriptive measures to prevent the financial loss of the hospital and patient.
